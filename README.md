# InventoryApp

This app is designed to be an internal inventory app optimized for use primarily on a smartphone or tablet. It can and will work on a desktop if desired.

The app is being deployed in a demo mode where most of the restrictions normally applied to prevent misuse have been removed to show basic functionality without requiring logins.

Deletes are still disabled to prevent unauthorized users from completely clearing out the database.

The pages of the application that are accessible to everyone are:

- Workstations
- Servers
- Network
- Locations
